Day 1 assignment for python
Create a simple Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
Perform the operation based on the user's input and print the result.
Example: If a user inputs 10, 5, and +, your program should display 10 + 5 = 15.

answers: 

# Get the numbers and operation from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
operation = input("Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): ")

# Perform the operation based on the user's input
if operation == "+":
    result = num1 + num2
elif operation == "-":
    result = num1 - num2
elif operation == "*":
    result = num1 * num2
elif operation == "/":
    result = num1 / num2
else:
    print("Invalid operation")

# Print the result
print(f"{num1} {operation} {num2} = {result}")
